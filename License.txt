License Note

This license is based on the open source nuget and therefore zlib/libpng license. 
The idea was to keep the license as simple as possible to encourage use of Michael.Types.Date in free and commercial applications and libraries, 
but to keep the source code together and to give credit to the Michael.Types.Date contributors for their efforts. 
While this license allows shipping Michael.Types.Date in source and binary form, 
if shipping a Michael.Types.Date variant is the sole purpose of your product, please just say no, and do let us know.
